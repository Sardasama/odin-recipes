    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Cassoulet (/ˌkæsəˈleɪ/,[1] also UK: /ˈkæsʊleɪ/,[2] US: /ˌkæsʊˈleɪ/,[3][4] French: [kasulɛ]; from Occitan caçolet [kasuˈlet] (listen) and cognates with Spanish: cazoleta and Catalan: cassolet) is a rich, slow-cooked casserole containing meat (typically pork sausages, goose, duck and sometimes mutton), pork skin (couennes) and white beans (haricots blancs), originating in southern France. It is named after its traditional cooking vessel, the casserole, a deep, round, earthenware pot with slanting sides.[5]

        The dish is said to have originated in the town of Castelnaudary, and is particularly popular in the neighboring towns of Toulouse and Carcassonne. It is associated with the region once known as the province of Languedoc.[6] An organization called The Grand Brotherhood of the Cassoulet of Castelnaudary (French: La Grande Confrérie du Cassoulet de Castelnaudary), has organized competitions and fairs featuring cassoulet every year since 1999.[7]

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound Tarbais beans, or other white beans, soaked overnight
        </li>
        <li>3 quarts seasoned chicken stock or broth
        </li>
        <li>4 ounces pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch dice
        </li>
        <li>2 bay leaves
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns
        </li>
        <li>6 sprigs thyme
        </li>
        <li>6 unpeeled garlic cloves, cut in half
        </li>
        <li>Reserved bones from duck confit and pork, if available

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse soaked beans and drain.

        </li>
        <li>Pour broth into a large pot. Add chopped pancetta, bones from duck confit, and the drained beans. Tie bay leaves, peppercorns, thyme sprigs, and garlic into a small square of cheesecloth to create the bouquet garni; add to the pot. Stir. Bring to a simmer over high heat; skim foamy scum that forms, if desired. Reduce heat to low until beans are almost tender, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle pork pieces with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; brown the pork pieces, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Add sausage to the skillet and cook in the same oil, turning until nicely browned on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Cut sausages in half and transfer to bowl with pork pieces.

        </li>
        <li>Remove fat and skin from duck confit and add them to the same skillet. Cook over medium heat until fat is rendered, about 3 minutes. Transfer all fat and browned pieces from the skillet to a mixing bowl. Add melted butter. Stir in bread crumbs and chopped parsley; stir until mixture looks like damp sand. Mix in about 1/4 to 1/2 cup broth.

        </li>
    </ol>
