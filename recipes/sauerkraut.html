    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Sauerkraut (/ˈsaʊ.ərkraʊt/; German: [ˈzaʊɐˌkʁaʊt] (listen), lit. "sour cabbage"[1]) is finely cut raw cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria.[2][3] It has a long shelf life and a distinctive sour flavor, both of which result from the lactic acid formed when the bacteria ferment the sugars in the cabbage leaves.[4][5] It is one of the best-known national dishes in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although in English-speaking countries it is known under its German name, it is also widely known in Eastern Europe and other places (see below). For example in Russia "k`islaya kap`usta" (кислая капуста) or "kv`ashenaya kap`usta" (квашеная капуста) has been a traditional and ubiquitous dish from ancient times.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds cabbage, thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sea salt
        </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
        </li>
        <li>water to cover
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix cabbage, onion, sea salt, and garlic together in a bowl. Firmly pack mixture into a large, clean, food-grade plastic bucket. The cabbage will start to make its own brine as the salt starts to draw out the water of the cabbage.

        </li>
        <li>Fill a large, clean, food-grade plastic bag with water and place over the salted cabbage mixture so none of the cabbage is exposed to air.

        </li>
        <li>Allow cabbage to ferment in a cool, dry place, 1 to 4 weeks (depending on how tangy you like your sauerkraut). The temperature of the room you ferment the sauerkraut in should not rise above 70 degrees F (21 degrees C).

        </li>
    </ol>
